## Evidence states and policy separation

Preserve raw measurements and assumptions separately from classification. Use
explicit states such as `measured`, `derived_from_declared_convention`,
`label_only`, `unknown`, `not_requested`, and `not_applicable`.

Only a caller-supplied, hashed policy may classify passivity, closure,
wavelength synchronization, polarization ratio, loss agreement, or mesh gates.
An evidence collector should not silently embed project thresholds.
Default one-point audit output to `evidence_only`; a successful collector is not
a project pass.

## Polarization

Do not infer incident polarization from a port `S/P` label or field maxima inside
a resonator.

Use a lossless all-air clone and sample median or RMS `abs(Ex)`, `abs(Ey)`, and
`abs(Ez)` in a named homogeneous top-air region away from the port and structure.
Persist:

- clone/source/configuration identity;
- sample entity IDs and coordinate range;
- requested/evaluated wavelength and incidence settings;
- aggregation method and component values;
- target/transverse ratios;
- all-air R/T residuals;
- cleanup evidence.

Total field at a reflective physical port is not incident-field evidence. Some
full-field formulations expose background-field variables that evaluate to zero;
verify the formulation before relying on them.
In particular, do not assume `ewfd.Ebx/Eby/Ebz` contains an incident field in a
full-field `PeriodicStructure` model.

For angular claims, test signed elevation in both directions, at least two
azimuth paths, and both polarization labels at sparse normal/intermediate/end
angles. Match the paper/design incidence plane and physical field direction
before comparing peak motion.

## Power closure and material loss

Record raw port R/T/A without clipping. For physical closure, define caller-
declared top and bottom flux planes inside real homogeneous media, with selection
IDs, plane positions, normal/sign conventions, medium identity, expressions, and
units.

Require finite passive R/T/A and compare:

```text
A_flux = 1 - R_flux - T_flux
A_volume = integrated Qh / declared incident power
```

Cross-section absorption and volume loss may agree because they share the same
normalization. Label that comparison `internal_normalization_consistency`; never
use it as a substitute for independent physical flux closure.

Persist per-domain `Qh` for lossy materials. Treat tiny signed values in declared
lossless domains as numerical noise only under an explicit tolerance.

## Wavelength synchronization

Whenever dispersion uses `wl`, record in every row:

- requested wavelength;
- evaluated global `wl`;
- `c_const/ewfd.freq`;
- exact material expressions or their configuration hash.

Diagnose any systematic difference before interpreting spectra.

## Provenance and source integrity

Every row or artifact should include:

- source model relative identity and SHA-256;
- normalized configuration ID;
- requested/evaluated point settings;
- physics, material, mesh, study, dataset, and selection identities;
- mesh expressions and observed element/DOF counts;
- raw R/T/A/flux/loss values and validation state;
- solve time, error, attempt, and durable timestamp;
- script/tool/schema hashes when applicable.

Never mix rows from different geometry, materials, mesh, normalization, or
selection definitions in one configuration. Re-hash the source after clone
cleanup.

## Peak finding and convergence

Use staged discovery:

1. Scan broadly and find every local candidate.
2. Extend if a maximum lies on or near a scan boundary.
3. Refine around each interior bracket.
4. Skip duplicate wavelengths between stages.
5. Save the branch identity and bracket evidence.

For angle sweeps, continue branches from the preceding angle with adaptive
windows. Scan the dominant polarization first; evaluate the suppressed
polarization at each accepted dominant-branch peak. Run a full suppressed scan
only when it is unexpectedly strong or another branch appears.

Compare every mesh at its own bracketed peak. Record fitted center, linewidth,
Q, residuals, baseline rule, threshold, and crossings. Fano, Lorentzian,
absolute-half, and half-prominence widths are not interchangeable. Use identical
spectral support and baseline definition across meshes.

A fixed-wavelength amplitude difference is a diagnostic, not convergence proof.
Adding positive loss cannot increase total Q; if simulated Q is already low,
audit geometry, radiation coupling, mesh, mode assignment, and fit definition.

Run mesh bridges at normal, intermediate, and endpoint angles before generating
a dense angle-wavelength map.

## Field artifacts and visual review

Evaluate field values and coordinates from a solved dataset, validate finite
matching shapes, then select and interpolate a declared slice. Store full arrays
in a bounded artifact such as compressed NPZ and return only hashes, counts,
extrema, component ratios, ranges, coverage, and a bounded sample.

For paired on/off-resonance evidence:

- use identical slice, grid, interpolation, units, and color limits;
- report missing-cell/coverage statistics;
- preserve source/configuration/dataset hashes;
- optionally render PNGs in an isolated plotting process rather than relying on
  headless COMSOL image export.

Numerical code may report ratios. It must not claim mode identity, symmetry,
localization, magnetic character, or publication quality. Require an image-
capable reviewer to confirm receipt of every artifact hash and return structured
observations/uncertainty. Visual review cannot override numerical policy gates.

## Cross-method comparison

Before explaining FEM/RCWA offsets:

1. Compare exact geometry bounds, dimensions, centers, materials/loss signs,
   selections, layer termination, lattice vectors, incidence, wavelength
   controls, mesh/order, and study definitions.
2. Create one immutable common baseline when any difference exists.
3. Run a small bridge matrix around all competing candidates.
4. Verify physical polarization and closure at each bridge point.
5. Refine every branch and compare each method/mesh at its own peak.

Do not let a scattered-field result with nonphysical absorption arbitrate a
physical port/RCWA disagreement.
